# n8n Zero to Hero

A comprehensive guide to mastering n8n workflow automation from the basics to advanced implementations.

## What is Automation?

A Predictable step by step process in which we transfer data from one point to another.

## Core Concepts of Automation:

- **Trigger**:
  An action/event that start the automation.

  1. Manual
  2. Schedule
     a. after every minutes
  3. Application
     a. Webhook
     b. Form Submission.

- **Filtering**:
  Filtering is used to allow or block certain type of data from following a path based on certain condition

- **Apps**:
  One of the main building block of automation is to connecting with the apps i.e slack, whatsapp

## What is workflow?

A workflow is a series of steps or tasks that are performed in a specific order to complete a particular process or achieve a goal.

## What is n8n?

n8n is a workflow automation platform that lets you visually design and automate complex business and technical processes. It enables you to connect multiple apps, APIs, and services without writing boilerplate integration codeâ€”but also allows you to add custom JavaScript and Python logic for advanced workflows.

## Key Features

- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Create automation workflows using a drag-and-drop interface, or write custom code when needed.

- **Extensible Integrations**: Over 400+ built-in integrations and 900+ ready-to-use workflow templates.

- **AI-Native Automation**: Design workflows with AI agents and integrate large language models or edge AI solutions.

- **Self-hosted & Cloud Options**: Use n8n locally, on your own server, or in the cloud.

## Workflows vs Agents in n8n

Understanding the difference between workflows and agents is crucial for effective n8n usage:

### Workflows

**Workflows** are the traditional n8n automation sequences that you create using the visual editor. They are:

- **Linear and Sequential**: Execute nodes in a predefined order
- **Trigger-Based**: Started by specific events (webhooks, schedules, manual triggers)
- **Deterministic**: Follow a predictable path based on conditions
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple items in a single execution
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error nodes

**Example Use Cases:**

- Data synchronization between systems
- Automated email notifications
- File processing and transformation
- API integrations with multiple services

### Agents

**Agents** are AI-powered automation tools that can:

- **Make Decisions**: Use AI to determine the next action based on context
- **Learn and Adapt**: Improve performance over time with feedback
- **Handle Complex Logic**: Process natural language and unstructured data
- **Autonomous Operation**: Work independently with minimal human intervention
- **Dynamic Responses**: Generate different outputs based on input variations

**Example Use Cases:**

- Customer service automation
- Content generation and processing
- Intelligent data analysis
- Natural language processing tasks

### Key Differences

| Aspect           | Workflows          | Agents                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Execution**    | Linear, sequential | Dynamic, decision-based |
| **Intelligence** | Rule-based logic   | AI-powered reasoning    |
| **Flexibility**  | Fixed paths        | Adaptive responses      |
| **Complexity**   | Structured data    | Unstructured content    |
| **Learning**     | Static behavior    | Improves over time      |
| **Use Case**     | Process automation | Intelligent automation  |

### When to Use Each

**Use Workflows when:**

- You have well-defined, repetitive tasks
- Data follows a predictable structure
- You need reliable, consistent results
- The process has clear decision points
- You want full control over the execution path

**Use Agents when:**

- You need to handle unstructured data
- The task requires natural language understanding
- You want the system to learn and improve
- Decisions need to be made based on context
- You're working with AI/ML applications
